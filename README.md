# repairTracker

## Description

repairTracker is a full-stack application using Node.js, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, JQuery and Bootstrap. 

This demonstrates full usage of C-R-U-D in a more realistic scenario by tracking a repair based on four different statuses (received, in progress, waiting on parts, complete) as one would in an automobile, electronics, appliance or other repair shop. Once the repair tech's side is complete, the customer will have a separate page from which they can view the status of their repair using their given Invoice #. 

Deployed Site: https://repairtracker.herokuapp.com/

FUTURE UPDATES: 
- Industry-specific variable tracking (i.e. make/model/year/serial)
- Users will be able to look up the current status of their order from a separate page
- Admin/Tech will be able to edit notes on order status change
- Marking an order paid will take in the price paid and log it for daily/weekly/yearly totals and averages
