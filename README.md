# repairTracker

## Description

repairTracker is a full-stack application using Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Passport, Handlebars, JQuery and Bootstrap. 

This demonstrates full usage of C-R-U-D in a realistic scenario by tracking a repair based on four different statuses (received, in progress, waiting on parts, complete) as one would in an automobile, electronics, appliance or other repair shop. Repair techs can log into the Employees section with a valid login (provided by the company's administrator) and customers can view the Tracker page to lookup the current status of their order. 

repairTracker is intended for use on an iPad in a mobile setting, but is responsive to all screen sizes.
